  Voila is developed by Visual Chameleon, Inc., a startup designing the first visual search application for online shopping on mobile devices. People love shopping online these days, but we often have hard times finding exactly what we want because many products are difficult to search with words alone. We believe the best tool to capture and identify wonders is our own eyes, and therefore we developed the first visual search app by applying advanced image recognition and machine learning technologies. Our app can now recognize and understand an object like humans, regardless of how the object appears in the photo or how busy the background is. Thus the app allows users to search and shop visually matched products via just a photo of any desired item.
p.
  We are to provide people the most intuitive way of shopping. With Voila, people shall find and purchase whatever they see and want instantly, and be able to compare a variety of similar products at their fingertips. We are to be the world first and best visual search engine in E-commerce.
